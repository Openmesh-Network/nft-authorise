# nft-authorise
Authentication library to confirm public-key metadata associated with an NFT via a signing challenge.

The aim with this library is to be a modular, portable SDK for soul-bound NFT authentication that can facilitate a handshake protocol whereby the receiver knows for certain that the send is the wallet owner of an NFT from the specified contract. This library is intended for DAO's which use NFT as an authentication mechanism.
